# Langchain-Text-Splitters

This repository offers a collection of custom text splitting strategies tailored for use with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/text_splitters/), a framework designed for developing applications powered by language models.

Effective text splitting is crucial in tasks like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where large documents need to be broken down into manageable chunks for processing by language models.

## ðŸ§  Overview

In natural language processing, especially when working with large language models, it's essential to preprocess and segment large texts into smaller chunks.
This ensures that the models can handle the input efficiently and maintain contextual relevance. This repository provides various strategies to achieve effective text splitting, each catering to different types of content and requirements.

For a detailed explanation of these loaders, refer to the [**Notes Document Loaders in LangChain.pdf**](https://github.com/Harsh-Jindal-web/Langchain-Text-Splitters/blob/main/Notes%20Text%20Splitters%20in%20LangChain.pdf) available in this repository.
